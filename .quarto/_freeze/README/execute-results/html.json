Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables\n    generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,\n    `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures\n    and tables in this file)\n  - [:file\\_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.\n  - [:file\\_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other\n    illustrations\n  - [:file\\_folder:\n    supplementary-materials](/analysis/supplementary-materials):\n    Supplementary materials including notes and other documents\n    prepared and collected during the analysis.\n\n## How to run in your browser or download and run locally\n\nThis research compendium has been developed using the statistical programming\nlanguage R.
